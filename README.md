# Business-Data-Analytics-Project

This repository underpins the dissertation “Patent Landscape Analysis in Electric vs. Hybrid Vehicle Technologies,” which systematically analyzes over 113,000 patents filed between 2014 and 2024 to reveal how innovation in electric (EV) and hybrid (HEV) mobility has evolved. We begin by querying the Google Patents Public Datasets via BigQuery—extracting publication numbers, titles, abstracts, filing and publication dates, CPC technology codes, and assignee names filtered by “electric vehicle” and “hybrid vehicle” keywords ![Data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c6e2ade-7392-468d-ad07-24b01bdd7f50) The resulting raw CSV is then processed with a Python pipeline: data cleaning, feature engineering, and imputation ensure a high‑quality dataset; Latent Dirichlet Allocation uncovers eight coherent topic clusters (including battery management, charging infrastructure, power electronics, thermal control, and connectivity); and statistical tests (t‑tests and chi‑square) confirm significant differences in growth rates and thematic emphasis between EV and HEV patents. All code is organized for transparency and reproducibility standalone scripts in the scripts automate each step, while the interactive Jupyter notebook walks you through the full analysis. Results, visualizations, and figures are available in the images directory. Feel free to clone, explore, and build upon this framework to conduct your own technology‑landscape studies.
